Hello!



I am a 3rd year PhD student at Princeton University in social psychology and the joint degree program in social policy.

I am broadly interested in developing and testing psychological theories about social normsâ€“well-known rules that govern what behavior is considered common and appropriate in a group. For example, when do people deviate from norms of their group? And when is exposure to the deviant behavior of a group member effective at changing observers perceptions of norms, and their behavior? Currently I use lab experiments to study these questions, but I am also interested in agent-based modeling and field experimentation.

While my current work focuses on signaling norms (e.g., norms of how group members should look), I am also interested in the study of moral norms (e.g., norms about the acceptability of violence), health norms (e.g., norms around the use of substances), and relationship norms (e.g., norms surrounding conversation and intimacy).
