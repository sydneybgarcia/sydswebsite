Welcome!

I am a 3rd year PhD student at Princeton University in social psychology and the joint degree program in social policy. I am broadly interested in studying the first step toward change in social norms (the well-known rules that govern what behavior is considered common and appropriate in a group): deviance. One of the overarching goals of my work is to understand how and when deviants aid in the process of changing the norms of a group. I am particularly interested in how deviants can spark change in gender norms, norms surrounding the acceptability of violence, norms about use of illegalized substances, and relationship norms such as those surrounding conversation and intimacy. For example, in one project, I am exploring how the effect of exposure to the deviant behavior of a group member on observers' perceptions of norms and their behavior might depend not only on how other group members react to the deviance, but also on higher-order reactions (i.e., reactions to the reactions). Currently, I use lab experiments to study such questions, but I am also interested in agent-based modeling and field experimentation.
