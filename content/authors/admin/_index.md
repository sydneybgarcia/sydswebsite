Hello!



I am a 3rd year PhD student at Princeton University in social psychology and the joint degree program in social policy. I am broadly interested in developing and testing psychological theories about social normsâ€“well-known rules that govern what behavior is considered common and appropriate in a group. For example, when do people deviate from norms of their group? And when is exposure to the deviant behavior of a group member effective at changing observers perceptions of norms, and their behavior? Currently I use lab experiments to study these questions, but I am also interested in agent-based modeling and field experimentation. While my current work focuses on signaling norms of how group members should look), I am also interested in norms about the acceptability of violence, norms about use of illegalized substances, and relationship norms such as those surrounding conversation and intimacy.
