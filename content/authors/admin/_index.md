Welcome!

I am a 3rd year PhD student at Princeton University in social psychology and the joint degree program in social policy. 

I am broadly interested in developing and testing psychological theories about social normsâ€“well-known rules that govern what behavior is considered common and appropriate in a group. For example, when do people deviate from norms of their group? And when is exposure to the deviant behavior of a group member effective at changing observers perceptions of norms, and their behavior? Currently I use lab experiments to study these questions, but I am also interested in agent-based modeling and field experimentation.

While my current work focuses on signaling norms (e.g., norms of how group members should look), I am also interested in the study of moral norms (e.g., norms about the acceptability of violence), health norms (e.g., norms around the use of substances), and relationship norms (e.g., norms surrounding conversation and intimacy). 

Before becoming a graduate student I was a research coordinator in Dr. Jamil Zaki's Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab where I primarily ran an experiment testing the effects of exposure to media (i.e., films) on empathy and social policy preferences. I received my BA in Psychology with a minor in Gender and Women's Studies from UC Berkeley (go bears!) where I was a research assistant in several labs. I helped to conduct research on diverse questions such as how memory support can improve therapeutic outcomes, and on cross-cultural differences in emotional expression. I also completed an honors thesis advised by Dr. Dacher Keltner on the relationship between political news media consumption and mental health among undocumented Latinos.
