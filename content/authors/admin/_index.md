Hello!

I am a 3rd year PhD student at Princeton University in social psychology and the joint degree program in social policy. I am broadly interested in studying the first step toward change in social norms (the well-known rules that govern what behavior is considered common and appropriate in a group): deviance. I am interested in questions such as: when do people deviate from the norms of their group? How do people react to deviants? And how and when do deviants aid in the process of changing the norms of their group? I am particularly interested in studying deviance from gender norms, norms surrounding the acceptability of violence and use of illegalized substances, and relationship norms such as those surrounding conversation and intimacy. Currently, I use lab experiments to study such questions, but I am also interested in agent-based modeling and field experimentation.
